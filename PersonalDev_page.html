    <li>I am a very stubborn person. Once I decide on something
  <b>no one <em>not even mi mada!</em></b> is going to talk me out of it. While I
  personally believe that stubbornness is strength of character, I do understand
  how this trait can lead to one’s downfall. So, keeping that in mind I have been
  careful to take into consideration other people’s input in some of my decision making. </li><br>

  <li>I try not to jump to conclusions when I see/hear something. <em>We all know how that
  turns out, I've seen the romcoms.</em> All jokes aside, over the years, I have come
    to understand how trying to see something from someone else’s perspective may
    help me to understand the full picture of something that I may have perceived
    differently when initially coming into contact with something that was said or done. </li><br>

  <li>I am incredibly slow to anger. However, I have seen how sometimes I do bottle
    my anger which every once in a while, can lead to unfortunate results, mostly for
    myself. Just know that, I have been working on finding healthy outlets for my
    emotions which includes talking about them more, <em> which if you have read about
    my dislikes on the <a href="Personal_page.html#Dislikes"> Personal Page</a>,
    you may already know this is not something I enjoy doing.</em> I have not yet
    gotten to the point I want with this, but I am getting there. </li>

  <h3 style = "margin-left: 25%;">CHAPTER 4: Achieve Your Goals</h3>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify"> Michael called Charlie so that they could meet at Mark’s Diner, a popular spot for maintenance men.
    Michael speaks to Charlie about how he has improved his relationship with his wife, but he laments that he
    is not sure how to improve his career.
  </p>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">Charlie asked Michael what his goals were, but he admitted that he had none.  After which Charlie tells
     Michael that is why he is not progressing in his career. He told Michael that he needs to write down his goals
     because this was the first step to achieving them. Because the process of writing down his goals would:
  </p>
  <ol type = "a" style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%">
    <li>Make him know to what he has to aim</li>
    <li>Make the goal a reality because the mind becomes “cognitively” aware and he will subconsciously start working
      towards his goals.  </li>
  </ol>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    Charlie also brings up something he learned from his mentor, Mr. Davies, who said that the main reason for writing
    goals is not necessarily to achieve them, but it is to become a better person after having achieved said goals.
  </p>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    Michael then goes on to share that he does not know where to start, to which Charlie advises that he “change direction”.
    He said Michael simply needed to choose where he wanted to go and then build a plan to get there. Charlie tells Michael
    to set long-term goals, then mid-term goals and finally short-term goals. Where each goal is set with the intention of
    eventually getting to the long-term goals. Most importantly, Charlie advises Michael, that all he simply needed to do was
    just start.
  </p>

  <em><u><h4 style = "margin-left: 25%;">My Thoughts on Chapter 4</h4></u></em>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    I have been given this advice before and I strongly believe that it is sound advice. I have tried to follow, but I have
    been discouraged. However, I cannot deny that this information is very invaluable and it has motivated me to pick up where
    I left off. To achieve my goals.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h3 style = "margin-left: 25%;">CHAPTER 5: The Proper Use Of Time</h3>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    Charlie quotes his mentor saying “We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret”,
    when Michael expresses that he does not have time. Charlie advises Michael to focus on the important things and not the
    urgent ones. Because according to him, the urgent things can enslave you and cause you to lose sight of what is important.
  </p>

  <em><u><h4 style = "margin-left: 25%;">My Thoughts on Chapter 5</h4></u></em>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    The quote mentioned by Charlie really stood out to me as this is something I often think of. The regret of not taking chances
    and making excuses. The quote re-enforces the idea of spending time to focus on important matters that you want to achieve before
    your time comes due.
  </p>

  <h3 style = "margin-left: 25%;">CHAPTER 6: Surround Yourself With The Best People</h3>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    Michael meets up with Charlie at Twelve Pillars, three weeks after their meeting at the Diner. Michael declares that he wrote
    down his list of goals and Charlie then proceeds to tell him the next step to success: to surround yourself with the best. Charlie
    advises Michael to surround himself with successful people, who live the values that he would like to acquire. Because this has the
    power to influence his destiny.
  </p>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    Charlie then makes the point, after Michael shared the behaviours and attitudes of his closest friends, that his friends may be why
    he is not progressing in his career and that he should re-examine his friend group. Charlie then proceeds to mention, Mr. Davies’
    advise on how to choose relationships, by:
  </p>
  <ol style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%">
    <li>Determining the type of relationship (whether it is a negative, neutral or positive relationship) and how to approach it.</li>
    <li>Deciding whether to disassociate, limit association or expand association.</li>
  </ol>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    Charlie advises Michael that in order to build relationships with people who are goal-oriented, he needs to become what he wants
    to attract. He also advises that association with these types of people opens up a wealth of knowledge and networking opportunity.
    Charlie lets Michael know that this is will not be easy, but it is necessary.
  </p>

  <em><u><h4 style = "margin-left: 25%;">My Thoughts on Chapter 6</h4></u></em>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    	For the most part, I believe I am surrounded by goal-oriented people. We may not have the same goals, but we believe our
      individual goals will lead to the same point; success.
  </p>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    Reading this chapter has made me grateful for the character that my parents have fostered within me, because I do not have
    people within my close circle who will lead me off my path. Those people do not seem to spend a long time in my life, thankfully.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h3 style = "margin-left: 25%;">CHAPTER 7: Be a Life-Long Learner</h3>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    Charlie continues on by mentioning that learning is the next pillar to success. He says that successful people are life long learners.
    According to Charlie, self-education builds fortune. When Michael inquires about what he can do to continue learning, Charlie highlights
    three ways to do this:
  </p>
  <ol style = "margin-left: 25%;">
    <li>Reading books</li>
    <li>Observing successful people</li>
    <li>Reflecting on your own experiences</li>
  </ol>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    When Michael starts to protest that he was not one for reading, Charlie advises that reading is important because it opens you up to
    new perspectives and by reading books written by successful people it allows you to know what they are thinking. Charlie shares with
    Michael a list of books and advises him to start by reading <em> Magic of Thinking Big</em> by David Schwartz.
  </p>

  <em><u><h4 style = "margin-left: 25%;">My Thoughts on Chapter 7</h4></u></em>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    I have been hit over the head multiple times with the lesson taught in this chapter. Other than fictional works and some historical/political
    information, I have to admit that I do not read as much as I should.
