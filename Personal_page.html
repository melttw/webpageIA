    I am not one for mottos or quotes from people, however, I am very big on
    learning lessons from those wiser, more experienced and far more well-read people
    than I. One of the best lessons I have learned is:
  </p>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    To questions things, especially people in positions of power. Because it is
    in questioning things that you may gleam more of an understanding of someone’s
     actions and it is through questioning things that you will come up with
     solutions when you have stumbled upon road blocks.

    I agree with most of the results of the Personality Test, most of which I was
    already aware. However, it is very clear that the creators of this test have
    a political bias. Specifically, a Western developed nation (These nations
    include places such as The United States, Canada and some European countries)
    left-leaning bias.
  </p>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    For example; they assume that because I strongly believe that in order for people
    to co-exist in a nation, their cultures/morals have to be similar, that I believe
    that people of different cultures living in one country is a bad thing. This is an
    asinine assumption to make.
  </p>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    Though I do have to admit, they were spot on with the careers suited for my personality. My favourite is
    assassin, maybe not in this life, but you never can tell &#x1F602;.
  </p>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: justify">
    I would also like to add that my result for the column Jung, formally known as
    the Myers-Personality Type Indicator, ISTP is one of the rarest personality types
    for women to have.  This is at least according to Truity.
